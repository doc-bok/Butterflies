# Butterflies
This mod adds butterflies with a full life cycle to the world of Minecraft. It
features 16 butterfly species, mostly based on real-life butterflies but a
couple of them are purely fantasy butterflies.

Butterflies will lay eggs in leaves if they get close to them, and if a player
collects these eggs they can plant them in other leaf blocks. The eggs will
eventually hatch into caterpillars. After living on the leaves for a short
time, a caterpillar will eventually build a chrysalis. These will then hatch
into new butterflies within the world.

Each butterfly species has it's own size, speed, rarity and lifespan. Some will
be larger, some will move faster, some will live longer than others.

Butterflies can be caught or released using a butterfly net. Once caught, they
can be bottled and placed in the world as decorative objects. 

They can also be pinned to a piece of paper to create a scroll where you can
look at the butterfly in detail. Unfortunately this kills the butterfly. These
scrolls can also be placed around your world as decoration. 

Scrolls can also be placed in a book, allowing the player to collect
information on each butterfly species.

If you want to breed the butterflies in this mod, then be sure to keep your
cats away from them!
