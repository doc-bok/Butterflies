# Butterflies
 This mod adds butterflies to the world of Minecraft. Butterflies can be caught
 or released using a butterfly net. Once caught, they can be moved into bottles
 and placed in the world as decorative objects.

 Butterflies will also lay eggs in leaves if they get close to them, and if a
 player collects these eggs they can plant them in other leaf blocks. The eggs
 will eventually hatch into caterpillars.
