# Bok's Banging Butterflies - A Minecraft Mod with Realistic Butterflies and Moths

This mod adds Butterflies with a full life cycle to the world of Minecraft. It
features several Butterfly species as well as several Moth species. Most are
based on real-life Butterflies but a few are pure fantasy creatures.

## Features 

### Butterflies and Moths

There are several species of Butterfly and Moths in the mod, each with their
own design and behaviour. Some will be larger, some will move faster, some will
live longer than others. Some are dimorphic, some love apples, some will live
in wood or fruit.

Butterflies can be caught or released using a Butterfly Net. Once caught, they
can be bottled and placed in the world as decorative objects. They can also be
pinned to paper if you want to keep a record of them.

### Eggs

Butterflies will lay Eggs in leaves if they get close to them. The Eggs will
eventually hatch into Caterpillars. If a player breaks the Eggs, they will
drop. Players can then replant these Eggs on other leaves.

### Caterpillars

After living on the leaves for a short time, a Caterpillar will eventually
build a chrysalis. If the Caterpillars end up on any other block, they will
instead starve to death.

Players can pick up Caterpillars and move them to other leaf blocks if they
wish.

### Chrysalises

Built by Caterpillars, these will eventually hatch into new Butterflies within
the world. These cannot be moved by players and will be destroyed if they
attempt to do so.

### Silk

Some Moth cocoons will drop Silk, which can be crafted into string or paper.
Unfortunately, this kills the Moth.

### Scrolls, Microscopes, and Books

Scrolls can be examined using the Butterfly Microscope, so you can learn more
about the various species. You can also use the Microscope to place the Scrolls
in a Lepidopterist's Book, allowing the player to collect all the information
in one place.

### Jars

Butterflies and Caterpillars can be placed into jars. These are decorative
items that can be placed in the world. Butterflies and Caterpillars placed
this way will not die, lay Eggs or create Chrysalises.

If you want to get the Butterfly or Caterpillar back, they can be released by
using the bottle while not highlighting a block.

### Flower Pollination

Butterflies will occasionally fly toward and pollinate flowers. This will spawn
flower buds that will eventually bloom into full flowers.

### Breeding

Butterflies can be bred by players feeding them their favourite flower (or
other plant). You will need to learn what their favourite food is by studying
the Lepidopterist's Book.

### Butterfly Feeder

These can be filled with food to allow automated breeding of Butterflies. They
can only take one stack at a time though.

### Lepidopterist

This new village will provide players with Butterfly-related trades.

### New Cosmetic Items

Butterfly Banners and Butterfly Origami add some Butterfly-related flavour for
builders and collectors.

### Peacemaker Butterflies

These creatures look like butterflies, but are actually aliens intent on taking
over your Minecraft world. Be wary if you encounter them.

### Secrets

There are a few secret features in the mod. Books with ancient poetry, strange
Moths from hell, and Butterfly-related structures. Can you discover them all?
